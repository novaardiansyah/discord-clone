# Real-Time Chat App: Discord Clone using Next.js and Tailwind

Welcome to my latest project, I've built a Discord clone built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This project is an endeavor to recreate the essence and functionality of the widely popular Discord messaging platform while utilizing cutting-edge web development technologies.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a practical example of building a real-time chat application from scratch, showcasing how Next.js and Tailwind CSS can be employed to create a stylish, responsive, and user-friendly interface. By exploring this project, you'll gain valuable insights into the world of modern web development, real-time messaging, user authentication, and more.

I encourage you to dive into the code, explore the features, and tinker with the inner workings of this Discord clone. Feel free to contribute, report issues, or share your feedback. Let's collaborate and make this project even better together!
